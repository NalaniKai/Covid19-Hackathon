# Summary
Due to the amount of time available, we decided to analyze the top 3 states with most cases in which also provides more samples: California, New York, and Pennsylvania. Our final process, as described below, was applied to all states. The data files and outputs for all states are available on our Github repository for review. We only include the process and outputs for California in this summary.

# Goal
Find different government policies that were impactful to the spread of new covid-19 cases.

# Data
We collected data from the NY Times on covid-19 cases by each state. We also used collected data from Imperial College London that had data on different policies the United States had implemented. We extracted the new cases per day by state from NY Time's data and merged it with different policy implementations on given days from Imperial College London's data. The resulting csv file is the combined_data.csv file in data folder (https://github.com/NalaniKai/Covid19-Hackathon/blob/master/data/combined_data.csv).
