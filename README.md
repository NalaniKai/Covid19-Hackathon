# Goal
Find different government policies that were impactful to the spread of new covid-19 cases.

# Data
We collected data from the NY Times on covid-19 cases by each state. We also used collected data from Imperial College London that had data on different policies the United States had implemented. We extracted the new cases per day by state from NY Time's data and merged it with different policy implementations on given days from Imperial College London's data. The resulting csv file is the combined_data.csv file in data folder (https://github.com/NalaniKai/Covid19-Hackathon/blob/master/data/combined_data.csv).
